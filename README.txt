# Tic Tac Toe Game : Ilay friedman

#General architecture of the application


The app includes 4 components:
1 - API :  a generic request to the API
2 - Login : Includes the login page
3 - Game : Includes the Game page
4 - Victory check: Include the victory calculation

#Reasoning behind main technical choices
I've decided to split all the "flow" to compnents and also all the complex logics to standalone compnents.

#Things you didn't implement or trade-offs you made.
1 - I think I would change all the Styling. 
You can see that I started to create sub folders in the "public" folder..
If I had more time I'll add fonts/icons formats..

2- I would add a game history
